 SUR_powering_the_light_desc:0 "The new 'Queen Wilhelmina Hydroelectric Dam' represents a milestone for the resurgent Dutch Government-in-exile. After five long years of construction, this new dam shall power everything from the lights of Mauritsstad to the aluminium production plants scattered across Suriname.\n\nFor the grand opening of the dam, Her Majesty is poised to make a rare public appearance in front of the TV cameras, presenting an image of power and defiance in the face of the loss of her and her people's homeland. The Dutch flag, now emblazoned with Her Majesty’s emblem still flies high over the rapidly developing coast of Suriname, Guyana, and the Kingdom’s Carribean holdings.\n\nYet time waits for no one, and Wilhelmina’s very advanced age is quite clearly visible. The time for great change in the status quo seems just around the corner as all eyes turn to her daughter, Princess Juliana who already has actively started to take up governance in certain aspects to assist her ailing mother.\n\nBut one more time, the Queen will speak to the Vrije Nederlanders and the world beyond."
