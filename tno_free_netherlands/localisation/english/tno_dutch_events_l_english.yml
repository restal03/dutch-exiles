 vrijdutch.1.t:0 "The Queen's Speech"
 vrijdutch.1.d:0 "There was a moment of pause in the crowd standing in front the well decorated platform in the jungle as the limousine approached. As the doors opened and her Majesty Wilhelmina stepped out the crowd cheered loudly. Flanked by heavy security on all sides she slowly walked over to the podium. Her very advanced age was belied by a firm look in her eyes that showed off the sheer willpower that had dragged her away from rest in her palace in Mauritsstad to the opening of the new hydroelectric dam named after her. As the Philips cameras rolled, the Queen started her speech.\n\nRefined yet determined she spoke into the microphone.\n\n  'Landgenoten.'\n\n'Twenty two years ago the Mof and the Jap had brutally invaded our homelands. Forced to flee to our Caribbean holdings, many a coward and defeatist had assumed that this would be the end. But we rose up and struck back in defense of our people, our history, and our legacy. The Enemy was swept from the Caribbean and though our homeland still lies in chains, we have built for ourselves a new one right here!'\n\nShe paused for a moment, readjusting her glasses and rummaging through her papers, seeming momentarily kind of lost as her age of 82 years showed clearly. Yet she recomposed herself and finished the speech.\n\n'This dam represents the promise of further development of our industrial might. With assistance from Shell and Philips, as well as our American partners this mighty dam has been constructed in the heartland of Suriname. It shall power our nation forevermore! And with that, I declare this dam to be open!' The ribbon was cut as the watergates were opened and the water began to flow outward. Nearby, a very large lightbulb lit up and the crowd cheered. As soon as her part was completed Her Majesty shuffled back to the limousine which quickly took off back to the comforts of Mauritsstad."

 vrijdutch.2.t:0 "Witnessing History"
 vrijdutch.2.d:0 "A lone figure walked on the beach. It was early morning and the sun's rays created a lovely spectacle reflecting on the calm waters of the sea. It was very quiet, with only the sounds of small waves hitting the sands providing some background noise to the sound of footsteps in the sand.\n\nThis was what he needed in this moment, a bit of serenity and solitude to relax himself. But even then, the West Russian War was on his mind. Thousands of miles away the Russians and Germans fought over the fate of Europe in a torrent of blood and fire. Tensions continued to rise more and more, and no one could tell how far this conflict could possibly go. Would this kick off the dreaded Final War that would certainly be the end of humanity?\n\nHe did not know. At least all of that was far away from here, and hopefully it would all pass by without the disaster and destruction that nuclear war would bring. Missiles flying overhead and...\n\nThe figure stopped as he could hear something fly over him. He glanced up but he had missed it. A jet flying over, perhaps. He returned back to his casual stroll when an explosion further inland shook him to his core.\n\n''What?! That's impossible, that's...''\n\nAnother one. And another one. More noise and explosions filled the air. Air raid sirens began to screech to life as the thunderous noise of explosions never seemed to stop. Dazed and confused, the man panicked, rushing through the dunes until he could get on the highest one, overlooking quite a bit of land. He watched another missile impact the ground miles ahead of him and explode in a massive fireball. As far away from the War as he could be, it had still found its way to him."
